            "entry": "Today I started Front-End over again with cohort 36. It was a little bit of a shock at first. Going through the initial set up and the same talks. Introducing everyone. Learning new faces. At first, I was disheartened, thinking I should've stayed with 34. That's a great cohort and I got used to my teammates! At the same time, moving to a new cohort simulates what it will be like to spend time with a team and then transition out and into a new one. I'm looking forward to the next three months to really solidify concepts from Front-End, but then I'm looking forward to doing Back-End. Python/Django is supposed to be a lot of fun. I'm ready to get back into React. This time I'll knock my capstone out of the park. NSS is a great adventure. I'm so grateful for this school.",

I'm pleased with the outcome of my page. I learned how to import icons as images wrapped in anchor tags that hyperlink to other websites. I felt like I grew in my CSS abilities on this project, as well as learning to be the person who has answers instead of feeling like I'm behind always having to ask someone else for answers. It will be interesting to see how repeating Front-End progresses.",
